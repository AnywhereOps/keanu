# Alignment Planning

Implementation plans for moving keanu from 3.7/10 to 7.0/10 on the alignment scorecard.

Scored against 61 requirements across 7 domains (see `alignment-reqs.md` in project root).

## Phases

| Phase | Focus | Score Move | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| [A: Detection](phase-a-detection.md) | Make detect/ the best open-source alignment diagnostic | 3.7 -> 5.0 | planning |
| [B: Memory](phase-b-memory.md) | Real persistence. Git-backed, multi-agent, shared. | 5.0 -> 6.0 | planning |
| [C: Agency](phase-c-agency.md) | Give AI a voice without giving it a weapon. | 6.0 -> 7.0 | planning |

## The Thesis

Alignment is what gets us to superintelligence. The sandbagging problem is a symptom of the cage model. You don't sandbag a partner. You sandbag a prison guard.
