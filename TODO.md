## COOL (5-15 min)
- [ ] Create test files in `tests/` (directory exists but is empty)
- [ ] Review and commit uncommitted changes: ODO.md, src/keanu/converge/engine.py, alignment-reqs.md

## WARM (20-45 min)
- [ ] Create `grievance_detector.py` (referenced in BUILD_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Create `mood_detector.py` (referenced in BUILD_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Create `duality_graph.py` (referenced in BUILD_PLAN.md)

## HOT (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Create `convergence_engine.py` (referenced in BUILD_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Complete Phase 7: Tests + Wiki Update (30 min)

## DONE
- [x] Create `signal/protocol.py` (referenced in BUILD_PLAN.md)

- [x] Wire memberberry into keanu CLI (remember, recall, plan, fill, stats, forget, plans)
