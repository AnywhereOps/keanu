Reads text through three color lenses, sees what the words alone can't, compresses what matters, and finds truth where opposing views collide. Built on Convergence Theory: reality operates on duality. Every tool here maps back to that.

## Modules

- **scan** - Triple-lens scanner (red/yellow/blue) with positive and negative poles
- **detect** - 8 pattern detectors via chromadb vectors, color theory mood synthesis
- **compress** - COEF (Compressed Observation-Execution Framework), content-addressable DNS, span export
- **converge** - Duality synthesis engine, 10 root dualities, RAG-driven convergence
- **signal** - Emoji codec, ALIVE-GREY-BLACK diagnostic, 3-channel reading
- **memory** - Memberberry store, git-backed shared memory, bilateral disagreement tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install keanu
keanu bake               # train lenses from examples
keanu scan document.md   # three-primary reading
keanu converge "question"
```
