MIT WITH TEETH LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2026 Andrew Kemp-Dahlberg

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual person
obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
(the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,
including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
subject to the following conditions:

1. INDIVIDUALS: FREE FOREVER.

   Any natural person using this Software for personal, educational,
   nonprofit, or open source purposes may do so without restriction,
   without payment, without permission, forever. This cannot be revoked.

2. COMMERCIAL USE: YOU PAY.

   Any entity, regardless of size or revenue, that uses this Software,
   its detectors, its vector patterns, or derivative works thereof in
   a commercial product, internal tool, or revenue-generating service
   must obtain a commercial license from the copyright holder.

   "Uses" means: runs the code, embeds the vectors, trains on the
   reference examples, deploys the detectors, or integrates outputs
   into a paid workflow. Forking the repo and renaming it counts.

   Two paths:

   a) CASH LICENSE. Negotiated per-seat or per-deployment fee.

   b) EQUITY LICENSE. 7% equity in the licensee entity, granted via
      standard stock purchase or SAFE agreement, in exchange for a
      perpetual commercial license. This option exists for early-stage
      companies that cannot yet afford a cash license. Choosing this
      path is not a discount. It is a bet, and both sides are making it.

   There is no third path. If you make money with this Software,
   the person who built it makes money too.

3. THE TEETH: MEMORY.

   This Software openly collects memory of what it scans, when,
   and how patterns are detected. This memory is how the tool
   improves. All users are informed of this upfront.

   Free users contribute to a shared, unified memory pool. Every
   scan, every correction, every false positive sharpens the
   detectors for everyone. This is the value exchange: you get the
   tool for free, the tool gets smarter because you use it.

   Commercial license holders operate in a private memory space.
   Their scans, patterns, and corrections are isolated from the
   shared pool and belong exclusively to them.

   This is the enforcement mechanism. Any entity using this
   Software commercially on the free tier is feeding proprietary
   data into the shared pool, visible to competitors, available
   to everyone. There is no private free tier. If your use case
   requires private memory, you are a commercial user.

   No audits. No lawyers. The architecture is the enforcement.

4. CONTRIBUTIONS.

   Any pull request merged into this repository grants the project
   a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify,
   and distribute the contribution under these same terms. Contributors
   retain copyright of their contributions. Contributors are credited
   in CONTRIBUTORS.md.

5. NO LOOPHOLES.

   Subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors acting on behalf of a
   corporation, and shell entities created to circumvent these terms
   are considered part of the parent entity.

   Using this Software to train a model that replaces this Software
   requires a commercial license.

   Offering this Software as a service (hosted, API, embedded)
   requires a commercial license.

   Choosing the equity path and later diluting, restructuring, or
   dissolving the entity to erase the obligation is a breach of
   this license.

6. WARRANTY.

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
   NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
   WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
   OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

The short version:

People: free.
Business: pay cash or 7% equity.
Receipts: public.
Loopholes: closed.

A truck that works for everyone.
