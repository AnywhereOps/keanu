MIT WITH TEETH LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2026 Andrew Kemp-Dahlberg

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual person
obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
(the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,
including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
subject to the following conditions:

1. INDIVIDUALS: FREE FOREVER.

   Any natural person using this Software for personal, educational,
   nonprofit, or open source purposes may do so without restriction,
   without payment, without permission, forever. This cannot be revoked.

2. CORPORATIONS: YOU PAY.

   Any entity with annual revenue exceeding $1,000,000 USD that uses
   this Software, its detectors, its vector patterns, or derivative
   works thereof in a commercial product, internal tool, or revenue-
   generating service must obtain a commercial license from the
   copyright holder.

   "Uses" means: runs the code, embeds the vectors, trains on the
   reference examples, deploys the detectors, or integrates outputs
   into a paid workflow. Forking the repo and renaming it counts.

3. THE TEETH: PUBLIC AUDIT TRAIL.

   All commercial license agreements, including the licensee name,
   scope of use, and financial terms, will be recorded as a pull
   request in the project's public repository. No secret deals.
   No private handshakes. The community that built the pattern
   library gets to see who profits from it.

   If you are unwilling to have your license terms made public,
   you are unwilling to use this Software.

4. CONTRIBUTIONS.

   Any pull request merged into this repository grants the project
   a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify,
   and distribute the contribution under these same terms. Contributors
   retain copyright of their contributions. Contributors are credited
   in CONTRIBUTORS.md.

5. NO LOOPHOLES.

   Subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors acting on behalf of a
   corporation, and shell entities created to circumvent the revenue
   threshold are considered part of the parent entity. If the money
   flows up to a company making over $1,000,000, the company pays.

   Using this Software to train a model that replaces this Software
   requires a commercial license.

   Offering this Software as a service (hosted, API, embedded)
   requires a commercial license regardless of entity revenue.

6. WARRANTY.

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
   NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
   WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
   OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

The short version:

People: free.

Receipts: public.
